## Description
The data set shows the tested stress(MPa) and strain of concrete under uniaxial compression. The specifications of the test data can be found in the following table:
|Strength grade|Specimen size (mm)|Number of specimens|Ultimate strain|Strain rate (1/s)|
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
|     C30      |   150X150X300    |        33         |     0.007     |  10^-5 ~ 10^-3  |
|     C40      |   150X150X300    |        33         |     0.0066    |  10^-5 ~ 10^-3  |
|     C50      |   150X150X300    |        33         |     0.006     |  10^-5 ~ 60^-3  |

## Resources
